SlackBuilds
===========

SlackBuilds from the UnixHub community.

Installation
------------

* Grab the SlackBuild along with any other files you see in it's directory. 
* Download the source to the same directory as the SlackBuild.
    (Unless you are building the git version, which will download itself.)
* Execute the script as root and install the resulting package with installpkg.

If there is a configuration file in the SlackBuild directory you can edit it
to your liking and it will be included in the build process. If you are
building the git version you may want to grab the latest config file from the
git repo by hand as things have probably changed.

Some SlackBuilds may include a pre-built package in its pkg directory.
