# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

compton: Compton was forked from Dana Jansens fork of xcompmgr and refactored. 
compton: I fixed whatever bug I found, and added features I wanted. Things 
compton: seem stable, but dont quote me on it. I will most likely be actively
compton: working on this until I get the features I want. This is also a 
compton: learning experience for me. That is, I'm partially doing this 
compton: out of a desire to learn Xlib.
